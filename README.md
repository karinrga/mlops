# ðŸ“Š Forecasting with MLOps
This repo is a tool for structuring, tracking data science and machine learning projects.

The mlflow tracker contains a wrapper class for using `MLflow` tracking functionality.
It initializes runs and performs different logging functionalities.


## ðŸ“ˆ Short Term Forecasting
This component includes methodology used for forecasting the short term load (day-ahead) and generation in an hourly resolution.

`NeuralProphet` is built on PyTorch and combines Neural Networks and traditional time-series algorithms, inspired by Facebook Prophet and AR-Net.

## ðŸ§ª Run experiment

```
poetry install
mlflow server --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8080
run python reference/run_neuralprophet_model.py -c config/tracker.yaml
```

## ðŸš€ Run streamlit

```
streamlit run Home.py
